## WEB SCRAPING
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting a large amount of data from websites. The data collected is stored in a structured format such as CSV, JSON, spreadsheet or database. These data can be used for various analytical and research purposes. 
Web scraping saves time and effort in data collection from multiple sources which must be done in an ethical manner without breaching the data policy of a website.
